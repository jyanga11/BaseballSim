# ⚾ BaseballSim


## Overview

This project models baseball games using a Markov chain-based simulation to analyze how different player types influence a team's seasonal performance. By simulating game sequences and player interactions, the model provides insights into strategic lineup construction and probabilistic outcomes over an entire season.

# Features
  - Markov Chain-Based Game Simulation – Models inning-by-inning transitions.
  - Customizable Player Profiles – Adjust batting averages, slugging percentages, and defensive stats.
  - Season Outcome Analysis – Tracks win probabilities based on team composition.
  - Data Visualization – Generates probability distributions and expected standings.

# Tech Stack
  - Language: Julia
  - Notebook: Jupyter
  - Libraries: Distributions.jl, DataFrames.jl, Plots.jl

# Key Insights
  - Power hitters vs. contact hitters – Which contributes more to season wins?
  - Pitching dominance – How does a strong pitching rotation affect win probability?
  - Optimal lineup strategies – How different batting orders impact scoring efficiency.

# Future Enhancements
  - Real-World Data Integration – Incorporate MLB statistics for model calibration.
  - Advanced Game Strategy Simulation – Include base-stealing, sacrifice bunts, and bullpen management.
